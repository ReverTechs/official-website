## 🚀 How It Works

### Content Flow
1. Admin edits content in `/admin/content`
2. Changes saved to Supabase database
3. Public website reads from database
4. Changes appear immediately

### User Registration Flow
1. User signs up at `/auth/sign-up`
2. Database trigger creates user record with role='user'
3. Admin runs SQL to upgrade to role='admin'
4. User can now access admin panel

### Message Flow
1. Visitor fills out contact form
2. Message saved to database via `/api/contact`
3. Admin sees message in `/admin/messages`
4. Admin can respond and mark as read
